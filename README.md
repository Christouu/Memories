Memories is a web application created with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
You can share your memories through out the year.
You can search memories by name and/or by tags.
You can add and view as much memories as you like , but you can only delete or update your memories only.

  - Redux-thunk
  - Material UI icons
  - Material UI core
  - JsonWebToken
  - React Hooks

For the BE, I am using:
  - Bcrypt
